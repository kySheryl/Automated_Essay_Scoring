# Automated_Essay_Scoring

This is a course project mentored by Prof. Sambit Sahu and Yuan Zhao for COMSE6998_013 Cloud Computing and Big Data in Fall 2021. 

It intends to solve the longstanding problem of high cost and low turnaround of current English writing tests. The goal is to shift testing away from standardized bubble tests to tests that evaluate critical thinking, problem solving and other 21st century skills. 

We have deployed a user-friendly website on AWS S3 connecting with 14 pre-trained machine learning models’ endpoints on AWS Sagemaker, that could provide scores and beat rate on users’ submissions. It gives good predictions on essays with high, medium and low performances.
